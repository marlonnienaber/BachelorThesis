Artemis represents an example for blended learning, as the platform avoids centering the learning experience around face-to-face lectures and instead integrates them with tutorials and asynchronous exercise assignments. This increased variety enriches learning opportunities but also amplifies the demands on effective time management. Artemis currently lacks a feature that specifically supports users' time management.

To address this, we introduce a new time management feature. At its center lies a calendar embedded in the course overview that displays important events related to lectures, exercises, tutorials, and exams. We enable course teams to show lecture and exercise events in the calendar early, without the overhead of having to create full lecture or exercise instances. Additionally, we extend course management with a schedule that enables course teams to add administrative events visible only to the team, thereby eliminating the need for external planning tools.

This thesis situates the proposed feature within a broader context by outlining the scientific motivation for its implementation and discussing related work. It then conceptualizes the feature by deriving requirements and describing it through several models. Finally, it documents the implementation by detailing the design goals, presenting the system architecture, and addressing access control and persistent data management.
