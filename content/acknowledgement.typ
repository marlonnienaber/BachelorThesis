I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Dr. Stephan Krusche for giving me the opportunity to write my bachelor’s thesis in a practically oriented environment. Over the past six months, this experience has allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development and gain valuable practical experience.

I also wish to thank my fellow students on the Artemis team for their support in reviewing and testing new code and for the many insightful discussions about feature development. In particular, I would like to thank Florian Glombik, Tobias Lippert, Moritz Spengler, Samuel Röttgermann, and Enver Kayandan for their continuous feedback and collaboration.

Finally, I am deeply grateful to my family for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout my studies and for enabling me to reach this point in my academic career.
