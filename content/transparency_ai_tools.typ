  Change this paragraph to reflect the tools you used in your thesis
]

To write this thesis, I used ChatGPT to refine the writing style of self-written paragraphs, not to generate text content. I also used Grammarly to improve wording and correct grammatical errors. Although I wrote the vast majority of the code for the feature developed in this thesis myself, I occasionally used ChatGPT for coding assistance. Before integrating any generated content into the thesis or the code, I carefully reviewed all results. Other than these tools, I did not use any additional AI assistance.
